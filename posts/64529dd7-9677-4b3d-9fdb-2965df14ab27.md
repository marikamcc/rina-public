Some of my friends fit the bill, but I need the same kind of cultural foundation on which to bond over gossip.  Like, I am not incredulous about an influencer buying a $200 pair of jeans.  (Maybe I am a bit for the same type of jean being bought over and over.)  Need other Bellevue Girl-types in my life.  Shouldn't the Bay Area be good for that?

On a related note, I highly recommend the podcast *Normal Gossip*.  I'm obsessed!
